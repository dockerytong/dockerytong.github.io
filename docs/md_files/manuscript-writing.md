# Introduction

# Materials and methods

## Materials and reagents

*Origin of the material* Natural pyrite from Qujing city (Yunnan, China).

*how the electrotrode was prepared* To prepare working electrodes for electrochemical tests, well-crystallized pyrite chunks were cut into cubic shapes (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 1 cm) using a diamond saw, glued to copper wires with conductive silver glue, and then encapsulated with epoxy resin. Before each experiment, the surface of the exposed electrode with an area of 2.25 cm^2 was polished with 1.0 and 0.3 µm alumina powder, cleaned with water and acetone, and then dried under nitrogen flow.


## Electrochemical apparatus and methods

All experiments were performed at 25°C, and all potentials
have been converted to the SHE scale using the correction +241 mV
vs Hg|Hg2Cl2|KCl(sat.) at 25°C.

**protein film electrochemistry**  Enzyme was adsorbed
onto the electrode surface by pipetting on 4 μL of YedY solution and
allowing this to dry for ∼10 min.

## DFT calculations

## Data analysis

Nearly all data processing and analysis was done in R (R Core Team, 2018) using tidyverse packages including ggplot2, dplyr, readr (Wickham, 2017), broom (Robinson and Hayes, 2018) and hms (Müller, 2018).

The nonlinear least squares (‘nls’) function in base R was used for *XXX* fits and the linear model (‘lm’) function was used for *XXX* fits.

Electrochemical data was exported from CHI software as text files with raw data, acquisition parameters and timestamps and then imported into R.

All values quoted are the average of at least
three experiments, and the error bars are the standard errors (SE) calculated from all repeat data.

## Data availability

All code used for data processing and analysis is available in a GitHub repository (github.com/dockerytong/__XXX__).

# Results and discussion

# Conclusion

*Major findings* 

*Implication for further research* Further research in hence needed to determine *建议1* and *建议2* before generalized conclusions can be drawn.
